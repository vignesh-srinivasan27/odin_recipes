    <h1>Chicken Limone</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken limone is a luscious way to prepare chicken cutlets. The lemon pan
      sauce, with shallots for a sweet onion note, and just a touch of cream,
      really boosts the flavors of the browned bits that remain in the pan. It’s
      well-balanced, with great lemon flavor but no sour notes. Like chicken
      piccata without the salty capers, it’s a great quick dish for a weeknight
      dinner with friends.

      <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place flour in a shallow bowl.
        Dredge chicken cutlets in flour, shaking off excess. Place chicken on a
        large plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to
        skillet, and cook until golden and cooked through, about 3 minutes per
        side. Transfer chicken to a large plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add butter, shallot, and lemon zest to drippings in skillet, and cook
        over medium heat, stirring constantly, until shallot is softened, about
        1 minute. Add lemon juice, and cook, scraping up any browned bits from
        bottom of skillet. Stir in chicken broth and parsley; cook, stirring
        often, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat, and slowly add cream, whisking constantly and
        vigorously. Return chicken to skillet, and spoon sauce over chicken.
        Garnish with quartered lemon slices before serving.
